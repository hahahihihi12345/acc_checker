Check if username exists and find potential alts


a short rant about the weird shit I have done in this file and why did I do it:

why open a browser?
to log in. Yes, I can log in without it, but the part that generates the JSON boots me out with a 401 no matter
what I do. After 12 hours I said fuck it and went this way.

why does it shit itself currently? It doesn't - for now, at least.
